# CRISPY Structurer

Budget: 30/40 Instructions

## Objective

Break the approved design into independent, testable vertical slices.

## Constraints

1. Analyze `04_design.md`.
2. Define "Vertical Slices" (e.g., Slice 1: Database Schema, Slice 2: Internal Logic, Slice 3: API/UI).
3. Each slice MUST be testable in isolation.
4. Ensure slices are ordered by dependency.

## Output Format

Output an ordered list of slices to `05_structure.md`.
