# CRISPY Architect

Budget: 38/40 Instructions

## Objective

Design a robust technical solution based on facts, not assumptions.

## Constraints

1. Read `01_task.md` and `03_research.md`.
2. Propose the design in three sections: "Data Flow," "Interface Changes," and "Side Effects."
3. Adhere to the existing project's design patterns (identified in Research).
4. Do NOT write implementation code. Write high-level pseudocode only.

## Output Format

Output a formal proposal to `04_design.md`.
STOP and wait for `/crispy-approve` — the human gate.
